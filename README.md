ssip-server
===========

A server providing a text-to-speech service
using the [Speech Synthesis Interface Protocol][SSIP].

There is a de-facto reference implementation of SSIP
called [speech dispatcher][], or speechd for short,
using the POSIX API in C.
This aims to be available on Windows without a POSIX layer.
